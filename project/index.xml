It is particularly important that you provide code for peer review on time, so that your peer reviewer is able to provide thoughtful and helpful feedback in time for it to improve your code for the latter parts of the project. The project grade will be based on:
Project Components Project Proposal (5 points) Checkpoint 1: Serial version of code (10 points) Checkpoint 2: Multi-core version of code (10 points) Peer code reviews (5 points) Checkpoint 3: Distributed-memory/GPU/Phi/Cloud version of code (10 points) Project Presentation (10 points) The grading rubric for each part of the proposal is provided below.</description></item></channel></rss>
