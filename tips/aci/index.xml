On the account request form,
specify ebf11 as the sponsor account, list Astro528 as the research description, leave computational and Data Requirements box blank (since they already know what will be required for the class.) Students who already have an ACI account should contact i-ASK to request that they add your account to the Astro 528 group.</description></item><item><title>Initial Setup for Astro 528 on ACI</title><link>https://psuastro528.github.io/tips/aci/initial_setup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://psuastro528.github.io/tips/aci/initial_setup/</guid><description>TODO: Need to update this page for Fall 2021 Setup Julia kernel to work with ACI&amp;rsquo;s Jupyter notebook server Browse to portal.aci.ics.psu.edu Login (if necessary) Click Interactive Apps on top menu Before using Julia on ACI for the first time Choose ACI Interactive Desktop Click Launch Wait while your job starts Once the Launch noVNC in new tab button appears, click it Open a terminal via second button on bottom toolbar Run the following code in the terminal module load python/3.</description></item><item><title>Jupyter Notebooks on ACI</title><link>https://psuastro528.github.io/tips/aci/jupyter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://psuastro528.github.io/tips/aci/jupyter/</guid><description>TODO: Need to update this page for Fall 2021 Start a Jupyter notebook session on ACI Each time in the future you want to start a Jupyter notebook session on ICS-ACI

First, try sshing from one ACI system to another (e.g., ssh aci-b.aci.ics.psu.edu). Does it just connect you? Or does it ask you for a password?</description></item><item><title>Running Jupyter on a GPU node</title><link>https://psuastro528.github.io/tips/aci/jupyter_gpu_nodes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://psuastro528.github.io/tips/aci/jupyter_gpu_nodes/</guid><description>TODO: Need to Update for Fall 2021
You can currently access a K4000 GPU on the ACI interactive nodes from the Jupyter notebook server. Students in the class can access more powerful P100 GPUs (with support for double precission arithmetic) via the CyberLAMP cluster by specifying the following PBS options:
-A cyberlamp_class -l qos=cl_class -l nodes=1:ppn=1:gpus=1 If you would like to run Jupyter on a GPU node, then you can try the following instructions kindly provided by Justin Petucci:</description></item></channel></rss>
