On the account request form,
specify ebf11 as the sponsor account, list Astro528 as the research description, leave computational and Data Requirements box blank (since they already know what will be required for the class.) Students who already have an ACI account should contact i-ASK to request that they add your account to the Astro 528 group.</description></item><item><title>Initial Setup on Roar</title><link>https://psuastro528.github.io/tips/aci/initial_setup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://psuastro528.github.io/tips/aci/initial_setup/</guid><description>Initial Setup for Roar / ICDS-ACI Request an account on &amp;ldquo;Roar&amp;rdquo;, the supercomputing facility run by Penn State&amp;rsquo;s Institute for Computational and Data Science (ICDS) Advanced CyberInfrastructure (ACI) group.
